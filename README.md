# SuperEar
<--- **SuperEar** is a research project focused on using acoustic metamaterials to achieve eavesdropping and tracking of phone calls in outdoor environments.  

The project incorporates gain balancing and noise suppression algorithms to optimize the raw audio captured by acoustic metamaterials, addressing issues such as uneven gain and noise interference.  

The code requires the SoX tool for operation (see SoX documentation).

Please adjust the audio file paths in the code based on your specific requirements.

The code is currently being organized, and the complete version will be uploaded soon. --->
